# LLM-File-Explorer

Create a file exploration tool that allows users to interact with and query files on their local machine using a combination of Ollama, LlamaIndex, Qdrant vector database, and a locally installed language model. This tool will make use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and retrieve relevant files.
